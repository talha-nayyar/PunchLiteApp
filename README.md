Install Required Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. 
Then, navigate to your React Native project directory and run:

npm install

This command will install all the dependencies listed in your package.json.

Start Development Server: You typically use react-native-app to start the development 
server for React Native projects. Assuming you're using Expo, you can start your development server with:

npm start

This command will start the Expo development server, and it will provide you with a QR code that you can scan
with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to preview your application.
